#### Meaningful Past

*One traumatic event from the character's past that shaped his or her future.
To connect this event to my own life, it may--while being a different
event--have the same emotional impact.*

#### Need

*The wound should leave the character with a need so intense that he or she
will be driven to fulfill it. These needs are universal, such as belonging,
love, family, self-worth, or faith.*

#### Weakness

*The wound should leave the character with a weakness, a character flaw that
seems out of the control or beyond the full awareness of the character.*

#### Strength

*The wound may also gift the character with a heroic strength that increases
his or her determination to fill the need and reach the plot goal.*

# Pre-draft

Old Scratch scratched his chin, the stubble making a raspy sound under his fingernails.

"Ya want what, now?"

"Her love," the boy answered. "That's all. Can't be hard, now, can it?"

The Devil suck at his teeth. "Hard? Nah. Ain't hard. But the price. Wooo-wheee. You sure you want to pay it?"

"If it ain't hard, it can't cost much." The boy scratched his head.

"That's what you'd think. Ain't hard, but it get out of control so quick-like. So yep. It costs you."

The boy shifted backward. "What does it cost?"

The thin man grinned, showing lots of crooked, yellow, pointed teeth. The boy leaned back more. "Ya's got to carry some-at for me. All the time. Until I want it back."

The boy squinted one eye. "What is it? Is it heavy?"

"It's small. It'll fit in your pocket." The Devil reached into his own pocket, took out a small leather bag and placed it on the table. It lay there limply.

The boy leaned forward and poked at it with a finger. It was tan and soft in spots, but most of its surface was worn, greasy, dark brown. The boy eyed it. Leaned back. Leaned forward. Squinted some more.

"I'll do it," he breathed, barely loud enough to hear. His hand shot out and grabbed the bag off the table before he could change his mind.

Scratch leaned back and grinned, his teeth yellow and sharp, his breath smelling of graves and lilies.
